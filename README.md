#### RFMT is a method used for analyzing customer value. It is commonly used in database marketing and direct marketing and has received particular attention in retail and professional services industries.

#### RFMT stands for the three dimensions:

#### Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?
#### Frequency – How often do they purchase?
#### Monetary Value – How much do they spend?
#### Tenure – number of days since first order

#### I analyzed two tasks. Credit cards and e-commerce.
