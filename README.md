#### RFMT is a method used for analyzing customer value. It is commonly used in database marketing and direct marketing and has received particular attention in retail and professional services industries.

#### RFMT stands for the three dimensions:

#### Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?
#### Frequency – How often do they purchase?
#### Monetary Value – How much do they spend?
#### Tenure – number of days since first order

In this task, I analyzed credit cards.
I used a jupyter notebook to work.
Based on the data from the dataset, the data are divided into clusters. I used three clustering methods: K means, Affinity propagation and Agglomerative clustering. Based on the conducted analysis, I concluded that the Affinity propagation method is the most relevant, because it gives the best results in this task.

Some of the conclusions:
1. there are many customers with whom a large number of days have passed since the last purchase,
2. there are loyal customers who can be rewarded with some gift,
3. loyal customers dominate over inactive customers.
