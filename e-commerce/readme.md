#### The second task is e-commerce.
#### Based on the data from the dataset, the data are divided into clusters. I used three clustering methods: K means, Affinity propagation and Agglomerative clustering. Based on the conducted analysis, I concluded that the K means method is the most relevant, because it gives the best results in this task.
