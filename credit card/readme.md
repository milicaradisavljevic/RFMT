#### Based on descriptive statistics, we conclude that there are 660 clients, the average credit limit is 34574.24, the average number of cards is 5, the average number of visits is 2, online visits 3, calls 4.
#### Based on the data from the dataset, the data are divided into clusters. I used three clustering methods: K means, Affinity propagation and Agglomerative clustering. Based on the conducted analysis, I concluded that the Affinity propagation method is the most relevant, because it gives the best results in this task.
